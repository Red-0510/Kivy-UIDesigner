TEAM NAME: DEARTH

Project: Building an UI designer that 
				helps design GUI apps layout
				(provided example : invoice app)

Bried Of Idea:
		Many times while creating GUI apps, designing 
		the layout and implementing that layout elements
		position-coordinates is troublesome for developers
		UI-Designers is GUI app that helps simplify the task
		of designing the layout and placing them 
		on the interface using drag-drop method
		My Project uses the basic elements like
		RelativeLayout,Button,Label,TextInput(to input data)
		to implement simple GUI and thus separating the task of
		desigining of layout and the actual logic or 
		data processing.

Tech Stacks Used: Python,KvLang,Kivy and 
							auto-py-to-exe to convert to .exe
		
			why kivy?
				-->kivy helps to build platform independent GUI apps
					Hence we dont have to write some separate code for ios,
					android,windows or other platform.
